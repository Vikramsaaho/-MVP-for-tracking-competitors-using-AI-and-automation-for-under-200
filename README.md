# -MVP-for-tracking-competitors-using-AI-and-automation-for-under-200

# Goal:
Automatically gather and analyze competitors' activities (website changes, product launches, news mentions, pricing, etc.) using low-cost AI and automation tools.
Core Features:
Competitor website tracking
Social media monitoring
Alerts for significant changes
Basic AI-powered analysis
Budget Breakdown:
Cloud Hosting (e.g., AWS Free Tier, DigitalOcean): $0-$20/month
APIs for data collection (e.g., NewsAPI, social media APIs): Free or minimal cost
Automation Tools (e.g., Zapier, Make): $20/month
OpenAI GPT API for AI analysis: Pay-as-you-go (within $50)
Miscellaneous Tools (e.g., scraping library, scheduling): $10-$30
Total Estimated Cost: ~$200 for 3 months.
# 1. Competitor Website Tracking
Use a web scraping library like BeautifulSoup or Selenium in Python to track changes on competitors' websites.
 # 2. Social Media Monitoring
Set up free access to Twitter or LinkedIn APIs for tracking posts from competitors.
# 3. News Mentions
Use NewsAPI for mentions of competitors in news articles:
# Step 2: Automate Data Collection
Use Zapier or Make to:
Schedule periodic data scraping (daily/weekly).
Monitor RSS feeds for updates.
Pull data from APIs and save to Google Sheets.
Example Zapier workflow:

Trigger: Schedule (e.g., daily at 9 AM).
Action: Scrape competitor data or fetch updates from APIs.
Action: Store results in Google Sheets.
Cost: Starts at $19.99/month for basic automation.

# Step 3: Analyze Data
Use AI (like OpenAI GPT-4 or open-source models) to summarize and identify trends:
# Step 4: Notifications and Reports
Set up email alerts using SMTP or services like SendGrid when significant changes are detected:
# Step 5: Dashboard (Optional)
Use Streamlit or Google Sheets as a simple dashboard:
# Deliverables
Web scraper for tracking website changes.
Social media monitor using APIs.
Automated workflow for periodic tracking (Zapier/Make).
AI-powered analysis for insights.
